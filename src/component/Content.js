              Founded in 2012, The Gateway School of Mumbai is a not-for-profit
              organisation dedicated to empowering children with disabilities.
              Together with our students, their families and our community of
              teachers, professionals and support staff, we work towards our
              common vision â†’ students will lead fulfilling, productive lives
              and be active contributors to society.

              Gateway was started by a parent of a child with special needs. We
              believe this collaboration, of parents and professionals, is the
              cornerstone of our success in working with students with
              disabilities.
